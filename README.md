# PleaseJustTellMeTheTime
We programmed a Rasperberry Pi to display a clock that tells the right time to everybody but one person. Specifically, in this case, we have it set so that if Srikar is in the frame of the camera, the clock will display a time that is 15 minutes ahead. With this in mind, the clock is intended to be a gift to a friend who is always late :)
